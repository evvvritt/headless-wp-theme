#Headless WP Theme
A theme that strips down Wordpress to use as a "headless CMS".

**to install**
navigate to /wp-content/themes/
```
git clone https://github.com/evvvritt/headless-wp-theme.git
```

#####recommended wp plugins
*not required* for this theme but I recommend these back-end oriented plugins
* WP REST API - json feeds
* Advanced Custom Fields - custom fields
* ACF to WP API - add acf fields to json
* EWWW Image Optimizer - losslessly compress images
* Imagemagick Engine - sharpens generated images (must enable php module)
* Force Regenerate Thumbnails - regenerate images and delete unused sizes
* WP Migrate DB - export databases
* UpDraftPlus Backup - backup files / databases
